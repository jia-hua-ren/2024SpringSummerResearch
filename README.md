To create functionally equivalent(FE) method pair dataset

c.py: This is the script that uses Clang to extract C/C++ methods from a C/C++ file. 
TODO: somehow detect macros in the preprocessing part and add those to the function extractions.
TODO: remove *any* use of user-defined types and only standard types from standard headers.

extract.py: this is the script that runs c.py on all files in a directory

cross_test.sh: this is for cross-testing. The script detects whether all tests are passed when ran on a specific method inside the group. 
TODO: need a way to store cross-testing results. Need to actually determine if the pair is FE (right now, it outputs "X and Y are functionally equivalent" when X passes Y's tests, but Y also needs to pass X's tests to be FE.

gen_tests.sh: a simple script that runs the UTBot cli generate test command on all files in a directory.

transform_test.py: This is the script that modifies a driver file for GoogleTest. The driver file is the one that allows test execution. How does it modify the driver file? This script extracts tests from the tests generated by UTBot (so run gen_tests first to get the tests), modifies the include to include the current method being ran, removes tests that results in error, modifies the tests to have the correct function name from the method file.

TODO: modify extract.py to rename functions to a generic name like \_\_test\_\_ to save work in transform_test.py. It removes the need to modify the tests to have correct function name for each test and method being ran.


General TODOs:
- in extract,py, save method informations to a sqlite3 db.
- etc... i cant think right now
